Physical Data Model (PDM)

Description

I created the physical data model using dbdiagram.io based on my logical model.

Each entity is converted into a table with a Primary Key (PK).
Foreign Keys (FK) are used to connect related tables.

Many-to-many relationships are implemented using junction tables:

program_course

class_course

educator_course

The model shows table structure, data types, and relationships clearly and is ready to be implemented in SQL.
